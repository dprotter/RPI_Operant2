File for setting up any necessary data for running tests! 

 ~ ~ Just Kinda Add To This As Needed ~ ~ 
This won't contain any actual tests. Just the data, configurations, and/or filepaths that are used throughout the experiment. 
For example, once we are testing software_functions_tests.py, rather than setting up a new Box instance for each test, we can just set that up in a function here and call that routine at the start of our tests.  
Ideally, this will make tests more consistent as well as simpler to write.
